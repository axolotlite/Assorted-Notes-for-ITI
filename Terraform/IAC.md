using infrastructure as code will allow us to codify the provisioning and deployment of infrastructure using code, normally shell code.
the main goals of IAC is to make provisioning easy, reproducable and maintainable.

this is where terraform comes in play, it allows us to use human readable efficient code to provision infrastructure.

this could be put in a source control environment, allowing us complete control over versions and state.
