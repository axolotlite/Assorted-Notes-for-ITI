## The different components of a docker ecosystem are:
* Docker Registry: Docker maintains all the images in the registry and they can be pulled from the registry too

* Docker Hub: This is the repository for all your custom-built images. Images can be pushed and accessed from the Hub

* Docker Client: The CLI tool used to interact with the Docker server

* Docker Daemon: The Docker server process responsible for pulling, pushing, and building the images. It is also used for running the container
