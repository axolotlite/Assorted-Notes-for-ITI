in a room of 40 engineers you'll get different answers,

devops is a prespective the eliminates barriers between people processes, and the technologies, so that IT can deliver fast and compliant software for the customer.
eliminating the negative to get to the outcome which is software delivery.

it overcomes them through:
1 - flow:

2 - feedback:

3 - continual improvement:


Developers want to release often and fast while valuing innovation and change
operations want to keep things up and running under their control in a stable manner

Automation: is the application of technology, programs, robotics or process to achieve outcomes with minimal human input.
it reduces complexity of managing a process and streamlines the process of realising software.

Measurements:
DORA:
Lead time to (D)eployment: how quickly new changes can be deployed without compromising quality of reliability
Deployment frequency: measures how often enw changes are deployed in production on a daily basis.
Change Failure Rate: how often do changes fails after production deployment.
Mean time to recovery: how long does restoration take from failure during production, this is for end user satisfaction.
