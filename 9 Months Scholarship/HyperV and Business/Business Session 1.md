we're not taking hyper-v today.
it's all business stuff.

Types of organizations we can apply to:
- vendors:
	presenting main services, they have the hardware
	You will work as a support engineer, your job is static and well defined, if you don't want to meet a lot of troubles and learn new things, you'll be given a protofolio when a ticket comes to you to fix it.
	static work style
	the first 3 months you'll be taught how to work, your entire job is tickets to solve problems related to the hardware vendor you work for, anything that you can't fix, will be escalated to level 2, given to someone more experienced in this vendor
	if you want to move up, you'll have to self-study
	like dell
	salary: good and standard. 2X

- telecom:
	It;s in the middle, like vendors, you'll get tickets to solve problems but they're not vendor specific, you get new hardware and products every year and you'll have to adapt to it and learn it.
	it's a mixture of routine and new projects / tooling
	like voda and orange
	salary: good and not standard. 1.5-2X

- integrators:
	It's random, things change, you work for someone who wants something to be done, you'll meet problems you never met before in different environments, you'll learn the most in here.
	since adaption is key.
	like raya
	salary:  dependant, uncertain. can be low and can be high depending on the demand.
	they hire almost instantly

#### Types of Interviews
Before entering an organization you'll be told what interviews you'll be given, from two to three of the following
Screening: you'll called by phone to check if you're qualified to enter the interview, you'll be asked basic questions at a random time.
to see if you're actually interested in the job or sane enough to do it.
he was called at 2AM, to get screened. 
technical interviews: you'll be asked about tools and concepts related to the job to check if you know what you say you know
soft skills: they ask you weird questions.
CBI (Competency based Interview): will have it's own section, since vodaphone focuses on CBI, to check your competency.
Managerial interview: the manager will interview you to see if you fit the role
HR interview
vodaphone does all the previous interviews except soft skills, they focus especially on the CBI.

#### Interview questions:
they're indirect, they want to test something in you so, they ask you about it.
they want to test your creativity or some other random quality than can't be quantified.
- introduce yourself?
they want to see how you talk, your english, how you story tell
- what college are you from?
again, same thing
- Do you have siblings?
again, they want to see how you converse.

general tip: any question that you feel trapped in, elaborate and talk a lot.
use the 5 W's!
HOW: did you join or do it
WHY: did you join? i'm passionate about that stuff
WHEN: did you join? in a good part of my life when i really wanted to do something
WHAT: made you join? it's a good place to learn which made me want to gain that experience, blah blah blah blah
WHERE: i don't know, wasn't paying attention
you could always use deflection to avoid questions and put yourself in a better place to answer.
### CBI:
it tests flexibility, human interaction, how you deal with problems.
they either record it for later review, or give you a buddy to monitor your problem solving problems.
they can give you a question to solve in 30 seconds then if the time passes it moves to the next one
##### story structure
This structure should be followed in all the professional settings, wether in presentations, oral reports and interviews
1) we talk about **the past** or **the situation**
2) then the **action taken**
3) talk about the present / **result of the action**

examples:
- introduction in english:
	wrong: my name is x and i'm from college x
	right: tell them a story about yourself, that doesn't basically say your cv info, my name is x, i've entered college x for reason x, and i decided to enroll in iti to reach x.
	another one: my name is x i was in college x, studying x, i've always liked x so i entered x in college, and even though i studied x in college it was not my passion, but i've learned about y in college, but it wasn't good enough to land me a job so I joined ITI track x to learn more about y and hopefully work in it.
- tell us your success stories?
	starting from here, the real CBI starts. as previously he wants a story for you to tell.
	olympic success story: from when i was young, i've loved swimming, i believed i could compete in it, so i enrolled in x cloud, trained hard and in 2012 the olympic preperations started, so i enrolled.
	i played against x in the competition and it was a hard fought victory, it allowed me to go to the olympics, i went undefeated.
	college story: i used to get terrible grades, 2.0 gpa levels of bad because i have other interests in college other than grades which made me busy.
	then came my grad project, which I was late for, because I was late, so i applied late which caused me to apply for a special project which was very hard, everyone else left it. 
	so I left everything else to focus on it, for the next 3 months I did nothing other than the grad project and got a B,which raised my grade and prevented me from studying for a whole other year. 
- tell us your failure stories?
	failed interview story: i recently graduated, looking for a job and got several interviews, I applied to one of them which asked me a lot of questions which i wasn't able to solve, i wasn't prepared, i fumbled it, didn't even read the job description. after this one, I decided to focus and prepare more for any interview.
- what would you do if you got into an argument with your boss / superior?
	example: I was a TA in college, my resident doctor made an exam, after suggesting it I told him that it's not a good fit nor is it up to standards, which caused us to argue, he believed that I'm interfering with his work and I had to compromise and find a solution, I understood that he wasn't happy with my comment so I went to sit down and talk with him to explain my point of view, I didn't intend to interfere with his work, I just wanted whats best for our students, so we went ahead with this exam and worked together on any exam that came after it, to increase the quality and ensure the best for our students.
	another example: I got into an argument with my boss about a late task, I misread the delivery date which made me decide to continue working to polish the feature until the perceived date came, I was suprised when my boss called me and I cleared the miscommunication with him delivering the task and from then on, I always delivered on time, never again have I misread the time or failed to deliver
- what process did you change in your job?
	example: I was in college and we usually took attendance using pen and paper, wasting at least 10 mins per lecture as the doctor calls their attending students name, so i told him about excel sheets, specifically google sheets, which means each person would go and record their attendance on it, which will be recorded on who wrote what and when. this made us start the lecture right away and anyone who put their names on different times were easily reprimanded.
- what's the difference between you and level 1 ?(you and someone lower than or in your current position)
	focus on the job description, using the story thing to prop yourself up
	There isn't a lot of difference between us, I'm a normal sys admin, but I like knowledge transfer, I like teaching new comers what I know and take challenging tasks that don't usually appear(this is the seniors job).

#### promotion interviews:
each promotion you'll get interviewed all over again, except technical since your boss who has more technical skill pushed you for this promotion.
#### Questions asked:
What are the ranges of jobs?

is there a problem if you say something much lower or higher than offered?
yeah, there is a problem, you better pick something within the range, our instructor recommends nothing less than 20k.
vendors may average above 19k to 21k.

passing technical interviews?
first, you must define what you're asked in the question, then answer it.
for example, "what is vcenter?" vCenter is a VM  installed in the data center environment, it's job is to manage esxi hosts
"what is ls?": it's an essential linux command that allows us to see the content of a directory.
implementing your skillset (both technical and non-technical) in your salary negotiation?
you're a team lead who transferred from one team into another company with another team?
you'll be asked about flexibility, so you can't say only one thing: I will apply the same methods from the old company here.
ideal answer: I talked with my manager to find the best direction to reach the goal of the companies target and I will plan the team according to that goal to achieve it, efficiently and well.
what are your weak points?
the point of this question is to check how you solve problems, specifically interpersonal problems.
it doesn't matter what your weakpoints are, as long as they're not really random, weird and unsual.
the question is split into the weakness and how you deal with it, you can say you feel anxious whenever you start learning something new, but after a while you learn it and everything becomes better.
if you're in a team and you have a deadline that depends on a team member that always finishes late. what do you to?
it tests your flexibility, you can't:
- tell the boss from the first time
- you go argue with your team mates
answers you can:
- discuss the problem with your team mate and check if there is anything you can do to increase the production
Why do i Pick you instead of someone else (hr interview)?
the HR member wants to know how you could apply your skills on the companies vision.
for example a company wants to digitize everything, even if they haven't fully realized this goal. telling them that you're experienced in virtualization and love to digitize stuff.
if you tell him that you love traditional infrastructure and work with them a lot, they'll have second thoughts about you.

Does technical skill trump HR priorities?
in some companies like the intergrators, they focus more on technical skills than interpersonal skills so they could sway the HR to make the interview easier and simple.

how important is english?
it's important in english dealing companies like VOIS and DELL, otherwise, vendors and integrators will not really focus on that.

how to change position internally?
it's easy to change positions internally in an organization, they usually have time limits and other stuff but it's easy to bypass it.
however, moving from one vendor to another, for example dell to vmware, they will have different products or styles of work.

how to get promoted quickly in almost any company?
you will have to work extra, extra hours for almost no pay, at the start.
if your work from 8AM to 4PM, most people will leave before 4, except a few people. since most team leads will arrive late and leave even later, so if they meet a problem they will deal with those currently present.
most leads will try to promote you quickly because your competence will help them rise in the ranks faster, they will give more work to those who will help them reach their targets.
each promotion may increase your pay by 50%.
how long would it take you to become a consultant in a vendor?
3 to 4 years

what's the most vacant jobs opening in vodaphone?
currently there is openings in Unix, however.
otherwise they all open at the same time.

post-acceptance interview tips:
general rule to help you in both interview and your job
use S.M.A.R.T communication:
you're in a meeting with a lot of people, if someone comes to say: "the server crashed!!!" and then went silent, anyone will tell you to get out.
he delivered a pointless piece of info without elaborating on it, he didn't specify if it was physical or virtual, if its reachable or not, no one can actually fix it in the middle of the meeting.
to apply SMART Communication, you can't just say anything to anyone.
lets fix this server problem.
first thing, you try to fix the problem yourself, if you fail, you escalate to someone higher in the middle of the meeting.
"the virtual server number x, responsible for service service X has crashed, I just got a mail alert about it."
most people don't stay long in an organization due to miscommunication and their inability to handle her coworkers and seniors.
if you're very professional, you'll gather everything you know about the server, who emailed you, how you failed to reach it and advice who to contact to ensure that it returns.

#### Notes for your CV:
use classic black and white, no need for colors, images or emojis.
start with your objective 
your education / experience
courses / technical skills: the skills you want to work with
certifications
experience and past projects: your grad project, anything you worked on by yourself or in teams
languages
soft skills
and finally references.
